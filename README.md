## Angular 2 Play with jspm, typescript, system.js and gulp tasks

I used zanettin's original seed as a starting point.

## TODO
- Upgrade to newer angular 2 (e.g. beta8.  Currently at alpha 37)
- See angular 2 typescript tutorial on angular official site for details
  to make beta 8 work.
- Get System.js on-the-fly transpiling to work.
